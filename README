Lulz is an advanced search engine for people. You're smart, you'll figure it out.

THIS IS VERY ALPHA SOFTWARE, lots of bugs, bad code, etc. Feedback, bug reports and suggestions gratefully accepted at dirtyfilthee@gmail.com

At the moment lulz is very untrained, i recommend using a timeout, i.e. --timeout 420. The timeout only prevents lulz from running new agents, it will still finish transforming and processing the profile queue. Also the output can be quite long, might be an idea to redirect output to a file. You can slim this output down by setting a high match value, say -m 0.8 



For usage info ./lulz -h 

Example search:

./lulz --alias dirtyfilthy --sex m --country nz --city christchurch --homepage www.dirtyfilthy.net --summary -m 0.8 --timeout 240

Status Key:

.		- running transformer
=		- running parser
*		- running search
?  	- performing identity resolution
!  	- recalculating action queue
W  	- queue empty, waiting
F  	- maximum number of agent threads reached
T  	- timeout reached, waiting on identity resolution & transformers to finish

Configuration & resources are setup in yaml files in config/defaults.yml and config/resource.yml respectively.
