lulz v0.02 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

You can use lulz with ruby1.8.x or ruby 1.9.1, 1.9.0 will not work. 

Release 0.02 breaks compatibility with the old database, you'll need to use the 
new lulz.sqlite3 file. 

AS ROOT

# apt-get install ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev rubygems libsqlite3-dev libxml2-dev \
libxslt1-dev libopenssl-ruby libgmp3-dev 

# gem install mechanize mofo hpricot nokogiri json sqlite3-ruby hoe \
activerecord flickraw

The stable version of debian does not come with a recent enough version of 
libsqlite3-dev, if you are installing under debian stable either use the 
unstable package or compile from source yourself. 

then from lulz root dir (as any user)

$ cd lib/identity_bayes
$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make

then from whereever you extracted the tarball (as any user)


./lulz -h 

You may also want to edit the resources.yml file in the config directory

:)
